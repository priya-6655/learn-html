	<h2>10 Benefits of Using Aloe Vera on Your Face</h2>
		<span>Aloe vera is perhaps one of the most widely used herbal remedies for topical skin conditions. This is because the gel-like components of the plant are known to heal the skin from a variety of minor ailments.

				In fact, you might have even used aloe in the past for sunburn, minor cuts, or small abrasions.

				Despite its healing powers, you may be wondering if it’s safe for using on your face. Generally speaking, the answer is yes. When used correctly, aloe vera can help with a variety of ailments that might affect your skin. Below are 10 of these benefits.</span>
	<h3>Base ingredient vs. plant</h3>
		<span>The aloe vera we use on our skin in over-the-counter (OTC) gels is derived from plants of the same name.

				In fact, there’s more than one kind of aloe, with an estimated 420 different speciesTrusted Source. The most commonly used form for skin conditions is a plant called aloe barbadensis Miller.

				In conventional medicine, aloe vera is used as a topical gel, which is made from the gel-like substance inside the plant’s leaves. It’s also possible to use the leaves directly by breaking them apart and pressing out the gel.

				However, it’s much easier to use gel that’s ready to go, especially in the case of emergency burns and wounds. OTC aloe gel may also contain other skin-soothing ingredients, such as echinacea and calendula.</span>
	<h3>Benefits</h3>
		<span>If you’re dealing with a chronic skin condition, it’s a good idea to check with your dermatologist before applying any products to your face. Talk to your doctor about the following potential<p style="font-size:25px;color:blue;">benefits of aloe vera:</p></span>
	<h5>1. Burns</h5>
		<span>For minor burns, apply aloe vera gel to the affected area up to three times daily. You may also need to protect the area with gauze.</span>
	<h5>2. Sunburn</h5>
		<span>While aloe vera helps soothe sunburn, researchTrusted Source shows that it’s not an effective way to prevent sunburn, so make sure you wear sun protection every day!</span>
	<h5>3. Small abrasions</h5>
		<span>If you’ve scuffed up your chin or forehead, you can apply aloe vera to the area for quick relief from pain and burning sensations. Use three times per day.</span>
	<h5>4. Cuts</h5>
		<span>If you’re used to grabbing Neosporin for a minor cut, consider trying aloe vera instead. Its molecular structure helps heal wounds quickly and minimizes scarring by boosting collagen and fighting bacteria. Apply up to three times per day.</span>
	<h5>5. Dry skin</h5>
		<span>Aloe vera gel absorbs easily, making it ideal for oily skin. However, it can help treat dry skin, too. Consider swapping out your regular moisturizer for aloe after bathing to help seal moisture into your skin.</span>
