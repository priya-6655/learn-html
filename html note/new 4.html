	<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<span>Lemongrass is a tropical, grassy plant used in cooking and herbal medicine. Extracted from the leaves and stalks of the lemongrass plant, lemongrass oil has a powerful, citrus scent. It’s often found in soaps and other personal care products.

				Lemongrass oil can be extracted, and it’s been used by healthcare providers to treat digestive problems and high blood pressure. It has many other potential health benefits, too.

				In fact, lemongrass essential oil is a popular tool in aromatherapy to help relieve stress, anxiety, and depression. Keep reading to learn more about how you can use lemongrass essential oil to improve your well-being.</span>
	<h3>1. It has antibacterial properties</h3>
		<span>Lemongrass is used as a natural remedy to heal wounds and help prevent infection. Research from 2010 found that lemongrass essential oil was effective against a variety of drug-resistant bacteria, including those that cause:

				skin infections
				pneumonia
				blood infections
				serious intestinal infections</span>
	<h3>2. It has antifungal properties</h3>
		<span>Fungi are organisms like yeast and mold. According to a study from 1996Trusted Source, lemongrass oil was an effective deterrent against four types of fungi. One type causes athlete’s foot, ringworm, and jock itch.

				Researchers found that at least 2.5 percent of the solution must be lemongrass oil to be effective.</span>
	<h3>3. It has anti-inflammatory properties</h3>
		<span>Chronic inflammation is thought to cause many health problems, including arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. Lemongrass contains citral, an anti-inflammatory compound.

				According to a 2014 study on animalsTrusted Source, oral lemongrass essential oil showed powerful anti-inflammatory abilities on mice with carrageenan-induced paw edema. The oil also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects when applied topically on mice with ear edema.</span>
	<h3>4. It has antioxidant properties</h3>
		<span>Antioxidants help your body fight off free radicals that damage cells. Research has shown that lemongrass essential oil helps hunt free radicals.

				According to a 2015 study, lemongrass oil mouthwash showed strong antioxidant abilities. Researchers suggest it’s a potential complementary therapy for nonsurgical dental procedures and gingivitis.</span>
	<h3>5. It may help prevent gastric ulcers or relieve nausea</h3>
		<span>Lemongrass is used as a folk remedy for a number of digestive problems, ranging from stomachaches to gastric ulcers. According to a 2012 study on mice, lemongrass essential oil helped prevent gastric ulcers, a common cause of stomach pain.

				Lemongrass is also a common ingredient in herbal teas and supplements for nausea. Although most herbal products use dried lemongrass leaves, using the essential oil for aromatherapy may provide similar benefits.</span>
	<h3>6. It may help ease diarrhea</h3>
		<span>Diarrhea is often just a bother, but it can also cause dehydration. Over-the-counter diarrhea remedies can come with unpleasant side effects like constipation, leading some people to turn to natural remedies.

				According to a 2006 study, lemongrass may help slow diarrhea. The study showed that the oil reduced fecal output in mice with castor oil-induced diarrhea, possibly by slowing intestinal motility.</span>
	<h3>7. It may help reduce cholesterol</h3>
		<span>High cholesterol may increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. It’s important to keep your cholesterol levels stable.

				Lemongrass is traditionally used to treat high cholesterol and manage heart disease.

				A 2007 study helps support its use for those conditions. The study found lemongrass oil significantly reduced cholesterol in rats who had been fed a high cholesterol diet for 14 days.

				The positive reaction was dose dependent, which means that its effects changed when the dose was changed.</span>
	<h3>8. It may help regulate blood sugar and lipids</h3>
		<span>Lemongrass oil may help reduce blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes, according to a 2007 study on rats. For the study, the rats were treated with a daily oral dose of 125 to 500 milligrams of lemongrass oil for 42 days.

				Results showed lemongrass oil lowered blood sugar levels. It also changed lipid parameters while increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels.</span>
	<h3>9. It may act as a pain reliever</h3>
		<span>The citral in lemongrass essential oil may help ease pain as it relieves inflammation. According to a 2017 study on people with rheumatoid arthritis, topical lemongrass oil decreased their arthritis pain. On average, pain levels were gradually reduced from 80 to 50 percent within 30 days.</span>
	<h3>10. It may help relieve stress and anxiety</h3>
		<span>High blood pressure is a common side effect of stress. Many studies have shown that aromatherapy eases stress and anxiety. Combining aromatherapy with massage may bring greater benefits.

				A 2015 study evaluated the effects of lemongrass and sweet almond massage oil during massage.

	<div>			Study participants who received a massage using the oil once a week for 3 weeks had lower diastolic blood pressure than those in the control group. Systolic blood pressure and pulse rate weren’t affected.</span>

		<h1 style="font-size:30px;color:red;"><b>1.Lemon Juice benifit</b></h1>	
		<h1 style="font-size=60px;text-align:center"><b>6 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Lemons</b></h1>
		<p> <pre><li>Lemons are high in vitamin C, fiber, and various beneficial plant compounds.</li>

<li>These nutrients are responsible for several health benefits.</li>

<li>In fact, lemons may support heart health, weight control, and digestive health.</li>

<li>Here are 6 evidence-based health benefits of lemons.</li></pre></p>
<h2>1. Support Heart Health</h2>
<pre>Lemons are a good source of vitamin C.

One lemon provides about 31 mg of vitamin C, which is 51% of the reference daily intake (RDI).

Research shows that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).

However, it’s not only the vitamin C that is thought to be good for your heart. The fiber and plant compounds in lemons could also significantly lower some risk factors for heart disease (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

For instance, one study revealed that eating 24 grams of citrus fiber extract daily for a month reduced total blood cholesterol levels (6).

Plant compounds found in lemons — namely hesperidin and diosmin — have also been found to lower cholesterol (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9).</pre>
<h2>2. Help Control Weight</h2>
<pre>Lemons are often promoted as a weight loss food, and there are a few theories as to why this is.

One common theory is that the soluble pectin fiber in them expands in your stomach, helping you feel full for longer.

That said, not many people eat lemons whole. And because lemon juice contains no pectin, lemon juice drinks will not promote fullness in the same way.

Another theory suggests that drinking hot water with lemon will help you lose weight.

However, drinking water is known to temporarily increase the number of calories you burn, so it may be the water itself that is helping with weight loss — not the lemon (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).

Other theories suggest that the plant compounds in lemons may aid weight loss.

Research shows that plant compounds in lemon extracts may help prevent or reduce weight gain in a number of ways (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).

In one study, mice on a fattening diet were given lemon polyphenols extracted from the peel. They gained less weight and body fat than other mice (14Trusted Source).

However, no studies confirm the weight loss effects of lemon compounds in humans</pre>
<h2>3. Prevent Kidney Stones</h2>
<pre>Kidney stones are small lumps that form when waste products crystallize and build up in your kidneys.

They are quite common, and people who get them often get them repeatedly.

Citric acid may help prevent kidney stones by increasing urine volume and increasing urine pH, creating a less favorable environment for kidney stone formation (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).

Just a 1/2-cup (4 ounces or 125 ml) of lemon juice per day may provide enough citric acid to help prevent stone formation in people who have already had them (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).

Some studies also found that lemonade effectively prevented kidney stones, but the results have been mixed. Other studies have shown no effect (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).

Therefore, more well-conducted studies need to examine whether lemon juice affects kidney stone formation </pre>

 Be Cautious of these 5 Lemon Water Side Effects
Lemon water is generally good for your health. However, there are several side effects of drinking too much lemon water. Here are the five side effects of Lemon Water, of which you must be very cautious. 

1. Causes tooth decay or enamel erosion
If one drinks too much lemon juice or consumes lemon juice frequently, then that person might experience tooth decay and dental hypersensitivity. This is because the lemons are highly acidic, like some citrus fruits. 


What to do?

Your teeth might suffer from damage if you drink hot lemon water frequently and regularly. So, don’t provide direct exposure to the lemon on your teeth. 
Similarly, don’t brush your teeth after consuming lemon juice, but drink a small amount of water after consuming lemon juice, which will help decelerate tooth decay. 
As said, don’t expose fresh, uncooked lemon directly to your teeth. 
2. Provoke stomach issues and heartburn
People consuming too many citrus fruits are prone to various stomach issues. They often suffer from problems like acid reflux, gastrointestinal problems, nausea, and vomiting. Heartburn is one of the significant problems caused by consuming too much lemon water.

What to do? 

If you are a lemon juice consumer and feel the symptoms of the issues mentioned above, you must consult a doctor before drinking lemon water. 
It is better that people with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) avoid drinking too much lemon juice.
3. Aggravate canker sores
It is generally known that too much citrus fruit causes mouth ulcers. Usually, both the Canker sores and mouth ulcers are excruciating for the patients. They are non-contagious small lesions that develop in the mouth. Drinking too much lemon juice could cause severe canker sores. 

What to do?

If you already suffer from canker sores, wait patiently until the mouth ulcers heal completely. 
After the canker sores get cured, you can drink lemon juice.
4. Results in migraines
Lemons produce a natural monoamine called tyramine. This tyramine is said to cause headaches. The citrus causes migraines and headaches in many cases. Though there is no proper proof for this concept, some studies have connected the intake of citrus fruits and migraines.

What to do? 

You must reduce the consumption of lemon juice if you are a person who often experiences extreme headaches.
5. Lemon skin serves as a host for harmful germs
In some cases, we can see lemon used on its skin. But, this lemon skin is a host for harmful germs in some conditions. However, few studies have shown that lemons contain microorganisms prone to some diseases. 

In a 2007 study, the researchers tested more than 70 lemon samples from restaurants in the above 35 visits. They revealed many lemons contained microorganisms, including some pathogens that might cause diseases.

What to do? 

You might have seen restaurants putting lemon wedges in lemon-based drinks. 
To minimize the risks of lemon skin, it is better to squeeze the lemon into your healthy drink rather than add the lemon skin to it.
If you see restaurant employees handling lemons with their bare hands, washing them with water is better if they come to your table. 
Lemon 
The lemon is a small, yellow-coloured fruit from the flowering plant family Rutaceae. This species of small evergreen tree is native to Asia and is primarily seen in India, Northern Myanmar, and China. Some consider that lemons came from India, as they are thought to have grown first in India, northern Myanmar, or China. According to a genomic study about the lemon, it was found that it might be a hybrid between bitter orange (sour orange) and citron, but there is no proof.</pre>

Fall in love with lemons

Lemon juice (and zest) just happen to sneak their way into everything from breads and muffins to dressings, main dishes, and of course, cakes, cookies, and bars. It adds freshness and acidity to things like dressings & marinades, plus adds bright flavor to sweet treats.

For ease, I broke these recipes down into:


Sweet breakfasts
Fruit & veggie salads
Quinoa & pasta salads
Sandwiches & wraps
Dressings & sauces
Snacks, apps & sides
Savory dinners
And incredible desserts
